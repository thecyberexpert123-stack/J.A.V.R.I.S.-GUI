"""Structured interpretation of a kernel plan and its blast radius.

``jarvis_preview`` returns considerably more than a list of step descriptions:
it reports the exact argv that would run, the safety tier, whether root is
required, whether the network is touched, which paths are affected, and --
crucially -- whether the action can be undone. The bridge's first version
flattened all of that into a single console line, which threw away precisely
the information an owner needs in order to consent meaningfully.

This module turns those payloads into value objects. It is pure: no Qt, no
I/O, no policy about what the UI does with the result. The one judgement it
does encode is :attr:`Plan.irreversible`, because "can this be taken back?" is
a property of the kernel's own ``undo.status`` field and should be read the
same way everywhere.

Verified against live payloads from kernel 1.18.0; see ``docs/BACKEND-BRIDGE.md``.
