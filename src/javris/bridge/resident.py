"""Resident-mode transport: the kernel's opt-in loopback doorway (ADR-0018).

The default remains the per-session spawn. This is the alternative for owners
who have run ``jarvis serve install`` and want the kernel reachable without the
GUI starting a process at all.

Two properties of the doorway shaped this client, and both were verified
against a running ``jarvis serve`` rather than taken from the ADR:

**The response envelope differs from stdio.** Over stdio the payload is
double-encoded -- ``result.content[0].text`` is a JSON *string* that must be
parsed again. Over HTTP the response is ``{"result": {...}, "isError": bool}``
with ``result`` already decoded. :func:`envelope_to_message` normalises the
HTTP shape into the stdio shape so that ``protocol.classify_outcome`` -- the
audited consent-classification path -- stays the single implementation. Two
parallel classifiers would be two places for the refusal/failure distinction to
drift, and that distinction is the one that must not drift.

**Consent semantics are identical.** Verified live: ``jarvis_do`` with a T2
request and no ``allow`` returns ``isError: true`` with
``outcome.status = "refused"`` and the same preview-then-allow hint. The
doorway holds no authority the stdio surface does not.

This client refuses to talk to anything that is not loopback. That is not
defence against an attacker who already controls the machine; it is a guard
against a misconfiguration silently turning a local doorway into a network
one, which is exactly what the kernel refuses to do on its own side.
