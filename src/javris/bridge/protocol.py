"""Pure JSON-RPC 2.0 framing and payload interpretation for the JARVIS kernel.

This module is deliberately free of Qt and of any I/O: it turns Python values
into wire lines and wire lines into decided outcomes, and nothing else. That
keeps the part of the bridge that must be *exactly* right -- consent handling
and error classification -- testable without spawning a process.

The wire contract is ``javris-frontend/1``, published by ``jarvis mcp describe``
and documented in the kernel repository at ``docs/integration/JAVRIS-GUI.md``.
Verified against a live ``jarvis mcp serve`` at kernel 1.10.2.

Security posture (see ADR-0013 M9a in the kernel repo): the front-end never
widens authority. ``allow`` is never synthesised here; :func:`build_tool_call`
requires the caller to pass it explicitly, and :func:`classify_outcome` reports
a refusal as a refusal rather than retrying.
