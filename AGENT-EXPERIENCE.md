## M0 — Research & Planning (2026-09-03)

### What I set out to do

Choose between the four named toolkits (Qt6, Flutter, Tauri, GTK4/GSK) on evidence
rather than preference, research what a JARVIS HUD actually is, and produce a plan
before writing any product code.

### Challenges encountered

**1. The repository was effectively empty.**
`git log` showed a single "Initial commit" and the tree contained one file, a two-line
`README.md`. There was no existing architecture, dependency set, configuration or test
suite to inspect — so guideline 12 ("inspect before modifying") resolved to
"there is nothing to preserve, and every decision is still open". That raised the bar
on guideline 9: with no precedent, the stack choice must be justified from scratch.

**2. The sandbox has no system package manager access.**
`apt-get update` failed on every Debian mirror; `deb.debian.org`, `ftp.debian.org`,
`mirrors.kernel.org` and `snapshot.debian.org` all returned connection failures, while
PyPI and GitHub were reachable. `apt-get install libgl1` returns *Unable to locate
package*. This single fact eliminated three of the four candidate toolkits from being
*verifiable* here: Tauri needs a Rust toolchain (`static.rust-lang.org` blocked),
Flutter needs its SDK (`storage.googleapis.com` blocked) plus CMake/GTK dev packages,
and GTK4 needs `pkg-config` and dev headers. Qt 6 survived only because PySide6 ships
self-contained manylinux wheels.

The important discipline here was **not to let convenience masquerade as architecture**
(guideline 20). "Qt is the only one I can build" is a real and decisive constraint, but
it is not by itself a good technical reason — so I went and found the independent
technical case too, and the strongest one turned out to be about GTK: `GskGLShader` was
deprecated in GTK 4.16 because the 4.14 renderer rewrite dropped support for it. For a
glow-and-scanline HUD that is a deprecated critical path, which is a genuine
architectural disqualifier independent of this sandbox. I have written both reasons
into `docs/RESEARCH.md` and still escalated the decision rather than assuming it.

**3. Qt would not import: four missing shared libraries.**
`from PySide6.QtGui import QGuiApplication` failed with
`ImportError: libGL.so.1: cannot open shared object file`. `ldd libQt6Gui.so.6` showed
four unresolved: `libGL.so.1`, `libEGL.so.1`, `libdbus-1.so.3`, `libxkbcommon.so.0`.

My first attempt — trivial one-symbol stub `.so` files — got further but then failed
with `undefined symbol: dbus_server_get_address, version LIBDBUS_1_3`. The lesson: the
loader checks *symbol versions*, not just soname. The fix that worked was to extract
every undefined `gl*`/`egl*`/`dbus_*`/`xkb_*` symbol from all the Qt shared objects and
plugins with `nm -D --undefined-only --with-symbol-versions`, generate no-op C stubs
(41 GL, 26 EGL, 89 dbus, 42 xkb), and link each with a matching `--version-script`.

**This shim is a sandbox artefact and must never touch product code.** Real Linux
desktops have these libraries. I am recording it because a future maintainer running
tests in a minimal container will hit exactly this wall — and because silently shipping
stubbed graphics libraries would be precisely the kind of thing guideline 1 forbids.

**4. Verifying the stack for real rather than assuming it.**
With the shim in place I ran a genuine end-to-end check: a QML file using
`Shape`/`ShapePath`/`PathAngleArc` — the exact primitive the reactor gauges will be
built from — loaded through `QQuickView` under `QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen` with the
software backend, then `grabWindow()` to a PNG. It produced a correct 400×300 image
with a clean cyan arc and letter-spaced type. That is the difference between "Qt should
work" and "Qt works here, and here is the picture".

**5. `pyside6-qsb` is broken in this venv.** It tracebacks on `--help`. Qt 6 removed
inline GLSL and requires shaders pre-baked to `.qsb`, so custom shaders are simply not
available to me right now. Rather than write shader code I cannot compile or test, I
scoped v1 to achieve glow with layered `Shape` strokes and opacity, and recorded shaders
as an honestly-deferred future milestone.

### Learning moments

- **Deprecation notices are architecture signals.** The GTK 4.16 `GskGLShader`
  deprecation was worth more to this decision than any framework benchmark blog post.
- **Cinema research changed the requirements, not just the palette.** Reading the
  designers' own accounts surfaced two things I would not have invented: the HUD is
  *mode-driven* (it recomposes wholesale between Analysis and Flight modes), and the
  critical literature identifies a real usability flaw — unlabelled cryptic telemetry
  like `N -8 W -97 RNG EL`. So R4 now mandates a label and unit on every readout. The
  reference is the *inspiration*, not the specification.
- **Surveying prior art paid off twice**: it produced a genuinely reusable pattern (the
  explicit eight-state assistant machine from Open.Jarvis, credited) and it justified
  the project's existence — almost every JARVIS GUI out there is Electron/web or
  Windows-first, so a Linux-native GPU HUD is an unoccupied niche rather than
  another showcase.
- **Licensing is a design input.** PySide6's LGPLv3 vs PyQt6's GPLv3 is a real
  downstream constraint, and choosing the binding on licence rather than habit costs
  nothing now and can save a lot later.

### Explicitly NOT verified

- Any rendering on real GPU hardware, X11, or Wayland — this sandbox has no `$DISPLAY`
  and no GL driver.
- Any frame-rate or performance claim. **The 60 fps target in the plan is a target,
  not a measurement.**
- Flutter, Tauri and GTK4 were evaluated from documentation only; none could be built
  or benchmarked here, and I make no first-hand performance claim about any of them.
- The plan's architecture is designed, not implemented. Nothing in `src/` exists yet.

### Where things stand

Three questions are blocking implementation and have been put to the stakeholder:
the toolkit confirmation, the v1 scope boundary (HUD shell with real telemetry vs.
integrating an assistant backend), and Python vs C++. No product code until then.

## M1-M6 — Implementation (2026-09-03)

### What I set out to do

Build the HUD the plan described: real telemetry, two modes, an enforced state
machine, honest failure states, and a quality gate that actually runs.

### Challenges encountered

**1. The QML `id: root` shadowing bug — the subtlest defect of the session.**

Every mode file declared `id: root`, and the shell instantiated them inside a
`Component` with `controller: root.controller`. That reads naturally, and it is wrong:
inside a `Component`, an unqualified `root` resolves to the *component's own* root
object, not the enclosing file's. So each mode was binding its `controller` property
to itself, and every child then read properties of `undefined`.

What made this dangerous is that **it rendered anyway**. The layout appeared, the frame
grabbed successfully, and the only evidence was `TypeError` lines in stderr that were
easy to dismiss as noise. Had I judged by the screenshot alone, I would have shipped a
HUD where an entire mode silently showed nothing.

The fix was to give the shell a distinct id (`hudSurface`) so the reference is
unambiguous. The general lesson: in QML, never reuse `root` across files that
instantiate one another, and treat `TypeError` in output as a failure, not as noise.

**2. `required property` fights `Loader`.**

The plan called for a `Loader` to swap modes. But a `Loader` evaluates the component's
bindings *before* applying initial properties, so a `required property var controller`
is still unset on the first evaluation pass and every binding sees null. I tried
gating with `active:` and a `ready` flag; both still produced a null pass.

I stopped working around it and removed the `Loader`. Both modes are now instantiated
directly and cross-faded by opacity. That is simpler, eliminates the entire bug class,
costs nothing (both modes are cheap), and makes switching instant since there is no
re-layout. A case where the simpler design was also the correct one.

**3. Context properties are invisible to the tooling.**

`setContextProperty("hudController", ...)` works at runtime but `qmllint` cannot see
it, so every single reference was reported as an unqualified access — six warnings I
could not fix without either suppressing them or changing the approach.

Suppression would have been the easy call. Instead I migrated to
`qmlRegisterSingletonInstance`, the modern Qt 6 mechanism, and wrote
`tools/generate_qmltypes.py` to emit the QML type description **from the live
`QMetaObject`** rather than by hand, so the description cannot drift from the code.
That got qmllint to *zero* warnings across all ten QML files and gave the linter real
type information about the Python object. It also forced renaming `Hud.qml` to
`HudSurface.qml`, since `Hud` now names the singleton.

Two follow-on details: the generated file needs `exportMetaObjectRevisions` encoding
the same version as the export (`(major << 8) | minor`) or the tooling complains that
they differ; and PySide6 6.11's type stub declares the singleton name parameter as
`bytes` while the runtime rejects bytes and demands `str`. The stub is simply wrong —
I used the runtime-correct value with a documented, narrowly-scoped `type: ignore`.

**4. A test that was wrong, not code that was wrong.**

`test_format_percent` asserted `format_percent(42.55) == "42.6"` and failed with
`"42.5"`. The temptation is to "fix" the code. But 42.55 is not representable in binary
floating point — it is stored as 42.549999…, so `.1f` correctly rounds down. The code
was right and my expectation was wrong. I rewrote the test with values that do not
depend on float representation. Worth recording because the reflex to make the failing
assertion pass by changing the implementation is exactly how a real rounding bug gets
introduced.

**5. Layout bugs a screenshot caught that no unit test would.**

Rendering to PNG and actually *looking* at it caught three defects that were invisible
to property assertions: values in the vitals rail overlapping their own labels (a `Row`
has no baseline of its own, so baseline-anchoring one silently misaligns); panels in
monitor mode clipped, because callers were computing panel height from the panel's own
children — a circular binding; and the reactor core rendering as a flat disc, which
looked like a sticker rather than an instrument.

This is why the headless render is in the gate even though Qt's own guidance says not
to use bitmaps as a pass/fail assertion. The image is not the test; it is the thing
that tells a human where to point the tests.

**6. Getting Qt to import at all in a container with no graphics stack.**

Covered in M0, but it bit again during CI design. The stub libraries are now generated
by a committed, documented script rather than existing as loose binaries I built by
hand, and the gate opts into them explicitly with `JAVRIS_GL_STUBS=1`. They are clearly
marked as never-for-production. A future maintainer hitting `ImportError: libGL.so.1`
in a minimal container now has an answer instead of a mystery.

### Learning moments

- **A rendering that appears is not a rendering that is correct.** The shadowing bug
  produced a plausible screenshot and a broken binding. Warnings in output deserve the
  same seriousness as a failed assertion.
- **Fighting the framework is a signal.** Both the `Loader` and the context-property
  problems dissolved when I stopped working around the framework and adopted the
  mechanism it actually intends. The workaround attempts were strictly worse code.
- **Generate descriptions, never hand-write them.** The `.qmltypes` file could have
  been written by hand in ten minutes and would have started rotting immediately.
  Deriving it from the `QMetaObject` makes drift structurally impossible.
- **`state` is a `QQuickItem` property.** Naming a custom property `state` compiles,
  runs, and misbehaves. qmllint caught the analogous `radius` shadowing on a
  `Rectangle`; the linter earns its place in the gate.
- **Designing for absent data changed the whole architecture.** Deciding early that a
  missing sensor must render as `--` and never as `0` propagated everywhere: `None`
  throughout the models, `-1` sentinels at the QML boundary, a distinct `unavailable`
  colour, and `degraded_sources` on every snapshot. Retrofitting that honesty later
  would have been a rewrite. The sandbox has no thermal zone, so the degraded path was
  exercised constantly rather than being theoretical.

### Explicitly NOT verified

- **No rendering on real GPU hardware, X11 or Wayland.** No `$DISPLAY` and no GL
  driver here; everything used the software rasteriser via `-platform offscreen`.
- **No frame-rate measurement whatsoever.** The 60 fps figure in the plan is a target,
  not a result. Animation smoothness, GPU behaviour and compositor interaction are all
  unverified and need testing on real hardware.
- **Full-screen and frameless window behaviour is untested** — it cannot be exercised
  offscreen and varies by window manager.
- **Keyboard interaction (Tab, Esc) and the console are untested end to end** through
  real input events; the command router beneath them has full unit coverage.
- Flutter, Tauri and GTK4 remain evaluated from documentation only.

### Where things stand

The gate passes end to end: ruff, ruff format, mypy `--strict`, 120 unit tests,
qmllint clean on all 10 QML files, 18 QML tests, and a headless render. The honest
next step is for a human to run it on a real Linux desktop, because the one thing I
cannot do from here is look at it moving.

## M7 — attention escalation

### Research that actually changed the product

The first research round gathered *appearance*: cyan, wireframes, cut corners.
Useful, but it produced a themed dashboard. The second round asked a different
question — what does the system *do* — and the answer reframed the work. The
single most valuable sentence found was the source analysis criticising its own
subject: little gauges wiggling in the periphery will not get the operator's
attention, so escalate the problem into the main display.

That is a *behaviour*, and it is what makes the thing feel like an assistant
rather than a monitor. Lesson: when researching a visual reference, deliberately
spend a pass looking for critique of it, not just description of it. The
criticism is where the design requirements are.

### The gaze proxy

The reference behaviour depends on eye tracking. We have none. The temptation
was to skip the feature or, worse, to imply capability we lack. Instead the
substitute — is this metric already central in the active mode? — is named
`Prominence`, documented as a proxy in three places, and never described as
attention sensing. It also turned out to be *better* than a hack: "don't escalate
what is already big and central" is genuinely correct on its own merits.

The cost is a coupling that will rot silently: `_CENTRAL_METRICS` in Python has
to match the mode QML layouts. That is called out in the design system, because
nothing enforces it.

### Hysteresis was not optional, and I got its scope wrong

Escalation dims the entire HUD, so a metric hovering at 0.70 would strobe the
whole display once per second. Streak counters plus a release margin fixed that.

But I applied the recovery streak to *every* release path, including "the
operator switched to a mode where this metric is central". A test asserting
immediate release failed, and the failure was right and the code was wrong. The
distinction I had missed: hysteresis exists to damp an oscillating **value**. A
mode change is not an oscillation, and neither is a sensor disappearing —
delaying those just leaves something untrue on the screen. Both now bypass the
streak entirely.

Worth noting the test caught this only because it was written from the docstring
I had already written, which described the intended behaviour correctly. Writing
the rationale first made the bug visible.

### The screenshot found what 158 tests did not

Every gate was green, and the rendered frame showed the header cheerfully
reporting **NOMINAL** next to a **CRITICAL** 96.0% memory alert. No test covered
"the header and the banner must agree" because it had not occurred to me that
they could disagree.

Same frame, two more: the mode surface was still at full brightness fighting the
alert, and the reactor core was ghosting straight through the hero number at
0.88 backdrop opacity — the precise low-contrast failure the research had warned
about, reintroduced by my own tasteful transparency.

This is the second milestone running where rendering an image caught a class of
bug the test suite structurally could not. The suite asserts that components
behave; it never asserts that they are *coherent with each other*. Rendering the
unhappy path is now a step, not an afterthought — which is why
`--simulate-alert` exists as a tool rather than as a throwaway snippet.

### Small things

- A `Behavior` cannot animate a `readonly property`. The error message
  ("Invalid property assignment") does not mention `Behavior`, so it reads like a
  binding mistake.
- `ruff` removes `# noqa: SLF001` when the rule is not enabled, and the fix
  suggestion silently discards the explanatory comment attached to it. Prefer a
  real comment over a `noqa` when the rule is not on.
- `.venv/` and `build/` are excluded from workspace snapshots, so both must be
  rebuilt at the start of a session. `pip install -e ".[dev]"` plus
  `tools/sandbox_gl_stubs.py` takes about 20 seconds. Worth checking before
  assuming a tool is broken.

## M8 — motion language

### Reading the user's own code was the highest-value research

The brief said "take inspirations from" a JARVIS GUI the user built two years
ago. That repo's `tailwind.config.ts` turned out to be a **34-keyframe motion
vocabulary** — `trace-in`, `particle-line-in`, `jarvis-letter-in`,
`breathing-glow`, `scanner-line-rotate`. That is a far more precise statement of
what the user actually wants than any amount of prose could be, because it is
their taste expressed as code.

None of it was copied — different language, different framework — but the
*concept inventory* drove the whole milestone. Lesson: when a user points at
prior work of their own, mine it for intent, not for snippets. Their config file
was effectively the design brief.

### Probe capabilities, don't assume them

Earlier notes said glow required layered strokes because the shader toolchain
(`.qsb`) was broken. I nearly carried that forward as "no effects available".
Actually probing found `QtQuick.Particles` **and** `QtQuick.Effects` both
present and loading fine under the software backend — the `.qsb` limitation only
ever applied to shaders *I* would have to compile. A 30-second probe file
invalidated an assumption that would have shaped the whole design.

### The review tool was lying to me

`--boot-progress` printed a filename and looked like it worked. It rendered a
different frame than requested every time, because `bootProgress` carries a
`Behavior`: assigning to it *retargets an animation* instead of setting a value,
and by capture time the animation had moved on. I only caught it because a frame
at progress 1.0 still showed the overlay, which contradicted the code.

The fix was not just reasserting the value at capture — it was making the tool
**print the value it actually captured**. A review tool that cannot tell you
what it rendered is worse than no tool, because it launders a wrong frame as
evidence. Any future capture flag should read back and report.

### Research that argues against the feature is the most useful kind

This round's brief was "more animations". The strongest source I found was the
critique counting **29 HUD elements, 87% of which move unasked, 6 of which risk
startle by expanding in place**. That is an argument *against* the request as
stated.

It did not mean refusing — it meant the difference between decoration and a
motion *language*: ambient motion is slow, low-contrast, behind everything, and
switchable off; nothing expands in place; nothing relocates a reading. The
`--no-ambient` flag and the `visible`-gating exist entirely because of that
critique. Taking the brief seriously meant finding the constraint that makes it
good, not maximising the literal ask.

### Small things

- A `Row` sizes to its *visible* children. Animating per-letter opacity inside
  one makes the whole word creep sideways. Fixed positions, measured from the
  font, are the answer for text that reveals.
- `Behavior` cannot animate a `readonly property` — the error says "Invalid
  property assignment", which does not point at the `Behavior`.
- An overlay without an opaque backdrop composites over live content and both
  become unreadable. Obvious in hindsight; invisible until rendered.
- Every new infinite animation needs gating on both the master switch *and*
  `visible`. Easy to add the first and forget the second.

## Round 4 — the assistant orb

**A refusal that the render tool exposed.** `headless_render.py` was asking for
`SPEAKING` and quietly getting `STANDBY`. The cause was not a bug in the orb: it
was the state machine correctly rejecting an illegal `STANDBY -> SPEAKING` jump
and logging the refusal to the console, where the screenshot dutifully captured
it. Two lessons. Rendering the wrong thing successfully is worse than crashing,
so the tool now fails loudly when it does not arrive at the requested state.
And a tool that drives a system under test must obey that system's rules rather
than assume it can set any field it likes.

**`readonly` and `Behavior` remain incompatible, and the linter does not care.**
`swell` was declared `readonly` with a `Behavior` attached. `pyside6-qmllint`
passed it clean; the runtime rejected it on the first frame. This is the second
time this exact trap has cost a cycle. Static analysis here covers types and
names, not the animation system — anything animated has to be seen running.

**Coherence is a correctness property, not a polish item.** During a fault the
orb went red but two standing arcs stayed cyan, because they were hardcoded to
`primaryDim` rather than derived from the tint. It read as "partly fine", which
is a false statement about system state. Any element that can be present during
a fault must derive its colour from the fault, not merely most of them.

**Three test failures, zero component bugs.** All three came from the harness:
`anchors.fill` silently overrode the width the clamping test was setting, so it
asserted against an unchanged 100 bars, and `swell` could not be read
synchronously once a `Behavior` eased it. A test that passes for the wrong
reason is the real hazard — the sizing test would have "passed" at any clamp
values had the range been wider.

**What was refused.** The 120 rim bars are tempting to drive from audio
amplitude. There is no audio: `PySide6.QtMultimedia` is not installed, verified
by import. Sizing bars from an invented signal would have looked convincing and
been a lie, so the ring encodes state only (D20). Likewise `EXECUTING` renders
no progress arc unless a caller supplies a real `activity` value; the default of
`-1` means "unknown" and draws nothing.

## Round 5 — lighting

**`MultiEffect` is a trap on this deployment.** It is the obvious tool for
bloom, it is present in the runtime, and `pyside6-qmllint` accepts it happily.
Under `QT_QUICK_BACKEND=software` it renders the source item as *nothing at
all* — not an unblurred fallback, but a blank rectangle. I only caught it
because I rendered the effect and its control side by side before building on
it. An always-on HUD cannot ship a decoration that can silently erase content
on a machine with no working GL, so the bloom is built from radial gradients
instead, which the software renderer draws correctly.

**Opaque fills defeat their own glow.** Both the orb core and the reactor
centre had solid gradient fills. Adding a bloom behind them produced a bright
ring around a black hole: the brightest object on screen was punched out at its
own centre. Making the fills translucent was what turned "a circle with a halo
sticker" into "a light source". The general rule: anything meant to read as
emissive must let light pass through it.

**Animating a property that already carries a binding.** The reactor's breathing
animation drove `opacity`, and `opacity` had just been rebound to
`bootProgress`. A `SequentialAnimation on opacity` overwrites that binding
outright, so the boot fade would have been silently lost. Retargeting the
animation to `intensity` kept both behaviours. This is the same class of bug as
the `--boot-progress` `Behavior` retargeting trap from an earlier round.

**A test that asserted nothing.** My first draft of the Glow suite contained
`verify(!glow.enabled || true, "placeholder for hit-testing")` — a tautology
that can never fail, dressed as a test. Replaced with a real check: a
`MouseArea` underneath a larger glow with `z: 1`, clicked through the middle,
asserting the control below still receives the event. Bloom overlaps
neighbouring controls everywhere in this HUD, so had it been hit-testable it
would have broken input in a way no visual review would catch.

**Verified against real values, not the local machine.** The gauge backlight
looked untested on screen because this container idles near zero, so every dial
stayed dark — which is correct behaviour but proves nothing. Rendering a strip
at 5% / 55% / 93% / unavailable confirmed the load ramp and the colour handoff.
A feature that only activates under conditions the dev machine never reaches
needs a synthetic harness, or it ships unverified.

## Round 6 — taking the reference further without copying it

**The reference had four ideas worth taking and one worth refusing.** The
screenshots showed corner brackets, a large clock, a specs panel and a power
readout. The first two are pure structure and were adopted directly. The specs
panel listed "ARK-2500 Reactor / Stark Industries GFX-9000 / 128 ZB RAM" and the
power cell read a permanent 100% — decorative fiction. Refusing them outright
would have lost a genuinely good layout idea, so both were rebuilt against real
kernel sources: `/proc/cpuinfo`, `/proc/meminfo`, `/etc/os-release` and
`/sys/class/power_supply`. The panel now shows this machine's actual Xeon and
3.8 GiB, and shrinks on a host that reports less.

**A visual bug three passing tests missed.** `PowerCell` lit each segment when
charge reached its *upper* edge. At 8% on a ten-segment cell that lights
nothing, so a nearly-flat battery looked exactly like a dead one. Every unit
test passed — they checked colour and the `low` flag, never the rendered
segment count. It was only visible by rendering the four states side by side.
The lesson repeats from Round 5: this container has no battery, so the control
could never have been exercised in situ, and a synthetic harness was the only
way to see it. Now covered by a data-driven test at 0 / 0.01 / 0.08 / 0.5 / 1.0.

**Absence is not degradation.** The sampler tracks `degraded_sources` for
telemetry it *should* have read and could not. A missing battery is not that —
desktops and VMs simply have none. Filing it as degraded would have put a
permanent false "DEGRADED: battery" in the header of every desktop. Absent and
broken are different states and must stay different.

**Peripherals lie about being batteries.** `/sys/class/power_supply` contains
mains adapters, USB supplies and HID devices alongside the real cell. A naive
"read the first entry" would report a wireless mouse's charge as the laptop's.
Filtering on `type == "Battery"` is the difference between telemetry and a
plausible-looking number.

**Layout collisions do not show up in the linter.** The host panel sat directly
on top of the CPU gauge, and qmllint was perfectly happy. Anchoring the centre
stage to the panel's right edge fixed it, but only after seeing it rendered —
and the fix then had to be made conditional, because ASSISTANT mode has no
panel and was left visibly off-centre by the first version of it.
